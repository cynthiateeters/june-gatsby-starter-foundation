**What Does "IDMX" Stand For? Course prefixes are a funny thing.**

You'd think it would be "IDWD" ("Interface Design & Web Development").

"IDMX" originally stood for "Interactive Digital Media & User Experience" but the program's final name revision occurred after the prefix was settled upon. As a result, we're saying that "IDMX" officially means, "Interface Design, Multimedia, & User Experience."

Regardless of what it is, "IDMX" and "Interface Design & Web Development" are the same thing. :-)

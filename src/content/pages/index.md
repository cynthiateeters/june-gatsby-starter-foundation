**What is IDMX?**

Interfaces are the lens through which we view our modern digital lives. Every interface, every point of contact with a computer system, must be designed by someone who has a deep understanding of how humans and computers mesh. Our favorite websites and apps on our computers and mobile devices, the screens in our vehicles, interactive displays in museums, and touchscreen kiosks - all of these things are connected via the Web and driven by interfaces.
